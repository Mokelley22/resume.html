<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Morgan Kelley. I am a web developer and content creator based currently in Indianapolis IN.
  I graduated from Ball state university in 2021 and have been working for Nexstar media group for the past 2 and a half years.
  Along with this i have gained expirience in leadership as well as managing multiple people when it comes to dealing with multiple issues.
  My position as a shift lead has me work with operators in order to keep tv stations across the country on the air and up and running 
</p>

<p>My work ethic is something i take pride in the most. I have always been taught to be a hardworker and to figure out any problem set before me.
  I will be one of the hardest workers you can hire. Any skill that i maybe lacking i will make effort to fix and improve in order to meet the requirements set before.
  When given the oppurtunity i will beat any and all expectations set before me. I will do everything in my power to complete a task. 
</p>

<p>Creating contetnt is also something i specialize in. Speciffically in the relam of video editing and shooting
  I have been taught multiple techniques and have my youtube up with the results of those from my time in Ball states telecommunications course. 
  During this time things on campus were difficult as it was in the middle of 2020 but i saw that as a unquie challenge and wanted to learn more. 
  I have a passion for learning as i see as one of the best things you can do in order to improve as a person.
